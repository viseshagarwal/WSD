Scenario: 
You are tasked with developing a data processing tool for a human resources department.
The department regularly receives employee data in XML format and needs to convert it to a more 
user-friendly HTML representation for easy viewing. Your goal is to create a complete program that 
can validate the incoming XML data against a predefined schema and then transform it into an HTML table. 
The department emphasizes the importance of data accuracy and consistency, so proper validation and 
formatting are critical.

Question: Imagine you are a software developer working for the human resources department of a company. 
Your task is to create a program that converts employee data from XML to HTML. 
You are supposed to create the following files:

employee_data.xml: Contains employee information in XML format.
employee_transform.xsl: Defines an XSLT transformation to convert the XML data into an HTML table.
employee_schema.xsd: Specifies the XML schema for validating the employee data.
convert_employee_data.py: A Python script that performs the XML to HTML conversion, including validation against the schema.

Your program should ensure that the XML data is correctly validated against the schema before generating the HTML representation. Describe the process of how your program accomplishes this task and maintains data accuracy and integrity throughout the conversion process. Also, discuss the importance of using XSD schemas and XSLT transformations in this context and explain how the Python script integrates these components to provide a seamless solution for the HR department's data processing needs.
